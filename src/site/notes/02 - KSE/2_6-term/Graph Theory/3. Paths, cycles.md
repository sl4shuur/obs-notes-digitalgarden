## Paths

A $\textcolor{Lime}{\text{path}}$ $P_n$ is a type of $\textcolor{Cyan}{\text{graph}}$ where the $\textcolor{Lavender}{\text{vertices}}$ can be arranged in a sequence $v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n$ so that the $\textcolor{Lavender}{\text{edges}}$ link each consecutive pair $v_i v_{i+1}$.

A simple $\textcolor{Lime}{\text{path}}$ has no repeated $\textcolor{Lavender}{\text{vertices}}$ or $\textcolor{Lavender}{\text{edges}}$, forming a linear chain through the $\textcolor{Cyan}{\text{graph}}$.

$\textcolor{Lime}{\text{Paths}}$ are fundamental for measuring distances and connectivity because the number of $\textcolor{Lavender}{\text{edges}}$ in a shortest $\textcolor{Lime}{\text{path}}$ gives the distance between two $\textcolor{Lavender}{\text{vertices}}$.

In applications such as routing and network flow, identifying $\textcolor{Lime}{\text{paths}}$ enables algorithms to find efficient routes through complex $\textcolor{Cyan}{\text{graphs}}$.

$\textcolor{Lime}{\textbf{Example}}$  
A $\textcolor{Lime}{\text{path}}$ $P_4$ with $\textcolor{Lavender}{\text{vertices}}$ $v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4$ has $\textcolor{Lavender}{\text{edges}}$ $v_1v_2, v_2v_3, v_3v_4$.

$\textcolor{Thistle}{\textbf{Metaphor}}$  
A $\textcolor{Lime}{\text{path}}$ is like stepping stones laid in a row across a stream, each stone connected directly to the next.

## Cycles

A $\textcolor{Red}{\text{cycle}}$ $C_n$ (or $n$-cycle) is a $\textcolor{Cyan}{\text{graph}}$ whose $\textcolor{Lavender}{\text{vertices}}$ $v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n$ form a closed loop with $\textcolor{Lavender}{\text{edges}}$ $v_1v_2, v_2v_3, \dots, v_{n-1}v_n, v_nv_1$.

When $n$ is $\textcolor{Orange}{\text{even}}$, we call $C_n$ an $\textcolor{Orange}{\text{even}}$ $\textcolor{Red}{\text{cycle}}$. When $n$ is $\textcolor{Orange}{\text{odd}}$, we call $C_n$ an $\textcolor{Orange}{\text{odd}}$ $\textcolor{Red}{\text{cycle}}$.

$\textcolor{Red}{\text{Cycles}}$ detect loops within a $\textcolor{Cyan}{\text{graph}}$ and are key to understanding structures such as feedback circuits or non-acyclic dependencies.

In chemistry and biology, $\textcolor{Red}{\text{cycles}}$ model ring molecules or closed metabolic pathways, revealing circular interactions.

$\textcolor{Lime}{\textbf{Example}}$  
A $\textcolor{Red}{\text{cycle}}$ $C_3$ with $\textcolor{Lavender}{\text{vertices}}$ $v_1, v_2, v_3$ has $\textcolor{Lavender}{\text{edges}}$ $v_1v_2, v_2v_3, v_3v_1$ and forms a triangle.

$\textcolor{Thistle}{\textbf{Metaphor}}$  
A $\textcolor{Red}{\text{cycle}}$ is like a roundabout where each exit leads to the next until you return to where you started.

## Connectivity via Paths and Cycles

A $\textcolor{Cyan}{\text{graph}}$ $G$ is said to have a $\textcolor{Red}{\text{cycle}}$ if there exists a **[[02 - KSE/2_6-term/Graph Theory/2. Subgraphs\|subgraph]]** of $G$ **[[02 - KSE/2_6-term/Graph Theory/1. Isomorphism\|isomorphic]]** to some $\textcolor{Red}{\text{cycle}}$ $C_k$.

Two $\textcolor{Lavender}{\text{vertices}}$ $u$ and $v$ in $G$ are $\textcolor{Orange}{\text{connected}}$ if there is a subgraph of $G$ $\textcolor{Orange}{\text{isomorphic}}$ to a $\textcolor{Lime}{\text{path}}$ $P_k$ with first $\textcolor{Lavender}{\text{vertex}}$ $u$ and last $\textcolor{Lavender}{\text{vertex}}$ $v$.

Connectivity via $\textcolor{Lime}{\text{paths}}$ defines whether information or flow can traverse the $\textcolor{Cyan}{\text{graph}}$ from one point to another.

The presence or absence of $\textcolor{Red}{\text{cycles}}$ differentiates acyclic structures like trees from more complex networks with loops.

$\textcolor{Lime}{\textbf{Example}}$  
In a tree $\textcolor{Cyan}{\text{graph}}$, any two $\textcolor{Lavender}{\text{vertices}}$ are connected by exactly one $\textcolor{Lime}{\text{path}}$ and there are no $\textcolor{Red}{\text{cycles}}$.

$\textcolor{Thistle}{\textbf{Metaphor}}$  
Connectivity in a $\textcolor{Cyan}{\text{graph}}$ is like a road network where towns are $\textcolor{Lavender}{\text{vertices}}$ and roads are $\textcolor{Lavender}{\text{edges}}$; $\textcolor{Lime}{\text{paths}}$ are routes, and $\textcolor{Red}{\text{cycles}}$ are loops you can drive around.

## Conclusion

We have defined two fundamental structures in graph theory: the linear $\textcolor{Lime}{\text{path}}$ $P_n$ and the closed $\textcolor{Red}{\text{cycle}}$ $C_n$, each characterized by specific sequences of $\textcolor{Lavender}{\text{vertices}}$ and $\textcolor{Lavender}{\text{edges}}$.

Paths serve as the building blocks for measuring distance and ensuring connectivity between $\textcolor{Lavender}{\text{vertices}}$, while cycles reveal loops that distinguish acyclic trees from more intricate networks.

Understanding how $\textcolor{Lime}{\text{paths}}$ and $\textcolor{Red}{\text{cycles}}$ embed into a $\textcolor{Cyan}{\text{graph}}$ via subgraph isomorphism underpins key concepts of connectivity and network structure analysis.
