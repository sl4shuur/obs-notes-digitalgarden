# Pigeonhole principle

---

## Proposition Statement

In any $\textcolor{Cyan}{\text{graph}}$ $G$ of order $n\ge2$, there must be two distinct $\textcolor{Orange}{\text{vertices}}$ sharing the same $\textcolor{Orange}{\text{degree}}$. This is the core claim of the proposition.

The proposition leverages the $\textcolor{Lime}{\text{pigeonhole principle}}$, which in this context says you cannot assign $n$ vertices to $n$ different degrees in $\{0,1,\dots,n-1\}$ without a repeat.

Interpreting the degrees as “pigeonholes” and vertices as “pigeons” immediately suggests that at least two pigeons land in the same hole, i.e., two vertices have equal degree.

This result highlights a fundamental constraint on how degrees can be distributed in a finite $\textcolor{Cyan}{\text{graph}}$.

$\textcolor{Lime}{\textbf{Example}}$  
In a path on $3$ vertices, the degrees are $\{1,2,1\}$, so the two end vertices both have degree $1$.

$\textcolor{Thistle}{\textbf{Metaphor}}$  
It’s like placing $3$ socks into $3$ boxes labeled $0,1,2$ where box $2$ ends up empty, forcing two socks into the same remaining box.

## Proof by Contradiction

Assume, towards a $\textcolor{Lavender}{\text{contradiction}}$, that all $n$ vertices of $G$ have pairwise different $\textcolor{Orange}{\text{degrees}}$.

Then the function  
$$d_G:V(G)\to\{0,1,\dots,n-1\}$$  
is injective, since no two vertices share the same degree.

But $|V(G)|=n$ equals the size of $\{0,1,\dots,n-1\}$, so an injective map between two finite sets of equal size must also be surjective.

This sets up the contradiction, because the map cannot cover all degree values.

$\textcolor{Lime}{\textbf{Example}}$  
If $G$ has $4$ vertices, an injective map to $\{0,1,2,3\}$ would require using each degree exactly once.

$\textcolor{Thistle}{\textbf{Metaphor}}$  
It’s like trying to seat $4$ guests at $4$ chairs but insisting nobody sits in a particular chair; eventually someone must.

## Injection Implies Surjection

Since $d_G$ is injective and both domain and codomain have size $n$, it follows that  
$$d_G(V(G))=\{0,1,\dots,n-1\}.$$  
Every degree value is achieved by some vertex.

In particular, there must be a vertex of degree $n-1$ and a vertex of degree $0$ under this assumption.

This would mean one vertex connects to all others while another connects to none, coexisting in the same graph.

Such a scenario leads to an impossibility in any simple $\textcolor{Cyan}{\text{graph}}$.

$\textcolor{Lime}{\textbf{Example}}$  
In a hypothetical $5$-vertex graph, one vertex would have degree $4$ and another degree $0$ if all degrees $0$–$4$ occur.

$\textcolor{Thistle}{\textbf{Metaphor}}$  
It’s like having a superstar who knows everyone at a party and a recluse who knows no one—yet they’re in the same tightly knit gathering.

## The Impossibility of Surjection

If a vertex $v$ has degree $n-1$, it is adjacent to every other vertex in $G$, so no vertex can have degree $0$.

Hence $d_G^{-1}(0)=\emptyset$, contradicting surjectivity which demands some vertex of degree $0$.

This contradiction nullifies the assumption that all degrees are distinct.

Therefore two vertices must share the same $\textcolor{Orange}{\text{degree}}$, proving the proposition.

$\textcolor{Lime}{\textbf{Example}}$  
In any simple $n$-vertex graph, you cannot simultaneously have someone who shakes hands with everyone and someone who shakes hands with nobody.

$\textcolor{Thistle}{\textbf{Metaphor}}$  
You can’t have a universal celebrity and a complete hermit at the same small party without overlapping acquaintances.

## Conclusion

By assuming all $n$ vertices have distinct degrees, we invoked the $\textcolor{Lime}{\text{pigeonhole principle}}$ to force injectivity and hence surjectivity of the degree map $d_G$.

Surjectivity implies both a vertex of degree $n-1$ and one of degree $0$, which is impossible in a single simple $\textcolor{Cyan}{\text{graph}}$.

This $\textcolor{Lavender}{\text{contradiction}}$ guarantees that at least two vertices must share the same $\textcolor{Orange}{\text{degree}}$, completing the proof.
