# Connectivity

## Definition of Connectivity

A $\textcolor{Lime}{\text{connected}}$ graph is one in which for every pair of its $\textcolor{Lavender}{\text{vertices}}$ there exists a $\textcolor{Lime}{\text{path}}$ connecting them.

If no such $\textcolor{Lime}{\text{path}}$ exists for some pair, the graph is $\textcolor{Red}{\text{disconnected}}$.

A $\textcolor{Orange}{\text{connected component}}$ of a graph is a maximal $\textcolor{Lime}{\text{connected}}$ $\textcolor{Lime}{\text{subgraph}}$ — you cannot add any other vertex or edge from the original graph without breaking connectivity.

The vertex sets of all $\textcolor{Orange}{\text{connected components}}$ form a partition of $\textcolor{Cyan}{V(G)}$, meaning each vertex belongs to exactly one component.

$\textcolor{Lime}{\textbf{Example}}$  
Consider a social network graph split into two groups with no friendships between them; each group is a $\textcolor{Orange}{\text{connected component}}$ and the entire graph is $\textcolor{Red}{\text{disconnected}}$.

$\textcolor{Thistle}{\textbf{Metaphor}}$  
A $\textcolor{Orange}{\text{connected component}}$ is like an isolated island of people who all know each other, with no bridges to other islands.

## Forests and Trees

A $\textcolor{Cyan}{\text{forest}}$ is an $\textcolor{Orange}{\text{acyclic}}$ graph — there are no $\textcolor{Red}{\text{cycles}}$ in any of its $\textcolor{Lime}{\text{subgraphs}}$.

Each $\textcolor{Orange}{\text{connected component}}$ of a $\textcolor{Cyan}{\text{forest}}$ is called a $\textcolor{Lavender}{\text{tree}}$.

A fundamental property is that any $\textcolor{Lavender}{\text{tree}}$ of **[[02 - KSE/2_6-term/Graph Theory/0. Definitions#Order and Size\|order]]** $n$ (having $n$ $\textcolor{Lavender}{\text{vertices}}$) has exactly $n-1$ $\textcolor{Lavender}{\text{edges}}$.

> $$E(T)=V(T)-1$$
> where $E(T)$ is the number of edges and $V(T)$ is the number of vertices in a tree $T$.
> This property holds for all trees, regardless of their structure or size.

This $\textcolor{Lavender}{\text{tree}}$ property underlies many algorithms, such as constructing minimum spanning trees and organizing hierarchical data.

$\textcolor{Lime}{\textbf{Example}}$  
A corporate hierarchy chart with no circular reporting lines is a $\textcolor{Cyan}{\text{forest}}$, and each department’s chart is a $\textcolor{Lavender}{\text{tree}}$ with one fewer reporting line than members.

$\textcolor{Thistle}{\textbf{Metaphor}}$  
A $\textcolor{Cyan}{\text{forest}}$ is like a grove of family trees, each $\textcolor{Lavender}{\text{tree}}$ spreading branches without ever looping back.

## Conclusion

We have defined $\textcolor{Lime}{\text{connected}}$ graphs and their maximal $\textcolor{Orange}{\text{connected components}}$, noting that vertex sets of components partition the graph.

We then introduced $\textcolor{Cyan}{\text{forests}}$ — graphs without $\textcolor{Red}{\text{cycles}}$ — and explained that each component of a forest is a $\textcolor{Lavender}{\text{tree}}$ with exactly one fewer edge than vertices.

These concepts of connectivity and acyclicity form the backbone of many graph-theoretic algorithms and real-world network models.
