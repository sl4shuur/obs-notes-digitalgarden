## Subset Notation

The concept of choosing $k$-element subsets from a set $X$ is captured by the notation $\binom{X}{k}$. Here, $X$ can be any collection of distinct objects, and $k$ is a non-negative integer. We define  
$$\binom{X}{k}:=\{A\subset X:|A|=k\}$$  
which collects all subsets of $X$ containing exactly $k$ elements.

This notation generalizes the familiar binomial coefficient when $X$ is finite; for $|X|=n$, we recover the number of $k$-element subsets, often written as $\binom{n}{k}$. In this abstract form, we focus on the subsets themselves rather than just their count.

Understanding $\binom{X}{k}$ is essential for defining the edges of an undirected graph, since edges are unordered pairs of vertices. The set $\binom{V}{2}$ will serve as the universe from which graph edges are drawn.

$\textcolor{Lime}{\textbf{Example}}$  
Let $X=\{1,2,3\}$ and $k=2$. Then  
$$\binom{X}{2}=\bigl\{\{1,2\},\{1,3\},\{2,3\}\bigr\}.$$

$\textcolor{Thistle}{\textbf{Metaphor}}$  
Choosing $k$ friends for a team from your class of $|X|$ students is like forming every possible group of size $k$ — that’s exactly what $\binom{X}{k}$ represents.

## Graph Definition (Undirected)

An **undirected graph** $G$ is specified by a pair $(V,E)$, where $V$ is an arbitrary set of **$\textcolor{Lime}{\text{vertices}}$** and

$$E = E(G) \subset \binom{V}{2}$$

is a collection of **$\textcolor{Red}{\text{edges}}$**, each edge being a two-element subset of $V$.

Vertices serve as the fundamental units or points in the graph, and edges connect pairs of vertices without any inherent direction. By restricting $E$ to subsets of size 2, we ensure that loops and multiple edges are excluded in this simple graph model.

This framework provides a versatile way to model relationships in networks, social connections, or any system of pairwise interactions.

$\textcolor{Lime}{\textbf{Example}}$  
A triangle graph has $V=\{a,b,c\}$ and  
$$E=\bigl\{\{a,b\},\{b,c\},\{a,c\}\bigr\}.$$

$\textcolor{Thistle}{\textbf{Metaphor}}$  
Think of vertices as towns and edges as bidirectional roads connecting them.

## Adjacency and Incidence

Two vertices $u,v\in V$ are called **$\textcolor{Orange}{\text{adjacent}}$** if the edge $uv$ belongs to $E$. In symbolic form,  
$$u\text{ and }v\text{ are adjacent}\iff uv\in E.$$

An edge $e$ is said to be **$\textcolor{Cyan}{\text{incident}}$** to its two endpoints $u$ and $v$. Incidence describes the relationship between an edge and each vertex it connects.

Understanding adjacency and incidence is crucial for exploring paths, connectivity, and other graph-theoretic properties.

$\textcolor{Lime}{\textbf{Example}}$  
In the triangle graph above, $a$ and $b$ are adjacent since $ab\in E$, and the edge $ab$ is incident to both $a$ and $b$.

$\textcolor{Thistle}{\textbf{Metaphor}}$  
If vertices are people, adjacency is like two people shaking hands; the handshake (edge) is incident to both participants.

## Order and Size

The **$\textcolor{Lavender}{\text{order}}$** of a graph $G$, denoted $n(G)$, is the number of **vertices**:  
$$n(G)=|V|.$$

The **$\textcolor{Peach}{\text{size}}$** of $G$, denoted $m(G)$, is the number of **edges**:  
$$m(G)=|E|.$$

Order and size quantify the basic scale of a graph and are fundamental parameters in graph analysis, impacting complexity and connectivity.

$\textcolor{Lime}{\textbf{Example}}$  
A triangle graph has order $n(G)=3$ and size $m(G)=3$.

$\textcolor{Thistle}{\textbf{Metaphor}}$  
In a road network, order is the number of cities, and size is the number of roads.

## Conclusion

This excerpt establishes the foundational definitions of simple undirected graphs. We introduced the notation $\binom{X}{k}$ for $k$-element subsets, defined a graph $G=(V,E)$ with vertices and edges, and clarified the notions of adjacency and incidence. Finally, we saw how the order $n(G)$ and size $m(G)$ measure a graph’s scale, setting the stage for deeper exploration of graph-theoretic concepts.
