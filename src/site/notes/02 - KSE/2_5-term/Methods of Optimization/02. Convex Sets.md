# Intro to Convex Functions

---

We’ve set the stage by understanding what optimization means — finding the best solution to a problem. But to truly master optimization, we need to understand the building blocks that shape these solutions. Before we dive into **convex functions**, we must first meet their **geometric backbone: convex sets**.

Convex sets are like the **terrain on which optimization takes place** — they shape where solutions can be found and how we navigate towards them. Without understanding the **landscape**, we can't understand how functions behave within it.

## The Cauchy–Schwarz Inequality

The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality is a fundamental tool in mathematics, especially in the study of convex functions. It states:

$$
| \mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{y} | \leq \|\mathbf{x}\| \|\mathbf{y}\|
$$

This inequality means that the absolute value of the dot product between two vectors $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ is always less than or equal to the product of their magnitudes. In other words, the angle between two vectors can never violate this limit — it sets the stage for understanding geometric relationships in convex sets and spaces.

## Convex Sets

A **convex set** is a collection of points where **any line segment between two points in the set remains entirely within the set.** This is the geometric definition of "no shortcuts" — everything inside the boundary is smooth and connected. Formally, a set $C$ is convex if:

$$
\lambda \mathbf{x} + (1 - \lambda) \mathbf{y} \in C \quad \text{for all } \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in C \quad \text{and } \lambda \in [0,1]
$$

This formula means that if you **pick any two points in the set**, the entire straight path (line segment) connecting them **stays inside** the set.

> This formula was derived from **coordinate geometry**, when we want to [divide a line segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_formula) into two parts according to some ratio.

## Visual Understanding of Convexity

- <strong><span style="color: var(--color-green);">Convex shape</span></strong>: The line between any two points stays inside the boundary (e.g., a hexagon).
- <strong><span style="color: var(--color-red);">Not convex shape</span></strong>: The line between two points "leaks" outside the shape (e.g., a shape with an inward dent or a hole).

This geometric difference is essential because convex sets **guarantee easier optimization** — the shortest path is always safe!

## Examples of Convex Sets

Convexity shows up everywhere in geometry and optimization. Here are common examples:

- **The empty set:** A trivial convex set (nothing to break the rule!).
- **A single point:** With only one point, any line between points is just that point.
- **A line or line segment:** Always straight — no curves or dents.
- **A subspace (like a plane through the origin):** Infinite, flat, and smooth.
- **A hyperplane:** A flat surface extending infinitely in multiple dimensions.
- **Balls and ellipses:** Round shapes where every line between points stays within the boundary.

## Properties of Convex Sets: Special Behavior

Convex sets have unique and useful mathematical properties:

- **Intersections of convex sets are always convex:**  
  If you overlap multiple convex sets, their common area remains convex.  
  <strong><span style="color: var(--color-green);">Example</span></strong>: Overlapping circles still creates a "smooth" region without dents.

- **Projections onto convex sets are unique:**  
  If you drop a point onto a convex set from above (like casting a shadow), there will be **only one closest point** — a unique solution.

## Why Convexity Matters

Convexity simplifies the search for solutions in optimization problems. In a convex set, there are **no traps, no false minima**, and the shortest route to the solution is direct. That's why understanding convex sets is a **superpower** for solving complex optimization problems!
