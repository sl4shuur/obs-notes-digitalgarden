# Projections

---

When we working with **[[02 - KSE/2_5-term/Methods of Optimization/01. Introduction to Optimization#Constraints vs. No Constraints\|constrained optimization]]** problems, the concept of **projection** plays a crucial role. It helps us find the **closest point** in a convex set to a given point outside the set.

The **projection** of a point onto a convex set is a fundamental concept in constrained optimization and mathematical analysis. It represents the closest point in a convex set to a given point outside the set.

## Definition

Given a **[[02 - KSE/2_5-term/Methods of Optimization/02. Convex Sets\|convex set]]** $C$ (associate with _Constrained Convex set_), the **projection** of a point $y$ onto $C$ is denoted by $P_C(y)$ and is defined as:

$$
P_C(y) = \arg\min_{x \, \in \, C} \|x - y\|^2
$$

This means that $P_C(y)$ is the point in $C$ that is **closest to** $y$ in terms of Euclidean distance.

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-aqua);">In simpler terms:</span></strong>

- If $y$ is **outside** the convex set $C$, the projection $P_C(y)$ is the **nearest point** on the boundary of $C$.
- If $y$ is **inside** the convex set, then the projection is simply $P_C(y) = y$.

## Properties of Projection

Let $C \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ be a **closed and convex set**. The projection operator $P_C(y)$ satisfies the following properties:

### 1. Non-expansiveness

The projection operator is **non-expansive**, meaning that it does not **increase distances**:

$$
\|P_C(y) - P_C(z)\| \leq \|y - z\| \quad \forall y, z \in \mathbb{R}^n.
$$

This ensures that the projection does not introduce additional stretching or distortion.

### 2. Idempotency

Applying the projection **twice** <strong><span style="color: var(--color-red);">does not change</span></strong> the result:

$$
P_C(P_C(y)) = P_C(y) \quad \forall y \in \mathbb{R}^n.
$$

This means that once a point is projected onto the set, projecting it again <strong><span style="color: var(--color-red);">does nothing</span></strong>‚Äîit remains in place.

### 3. Optimality Condition

The projection $P_C(y)$ is the **closest point** to $y$ in $C$, meaning it satisfies the first-order **optimality condition**:

$$
(y - P_C(y))(x - P_C(y)) \leq 0 \quad \forall x \in C, \quad \forall y \in \mathbb{R}^n.
$$

This condition ensures that the **difference vector** $y - P_C(y)$ is orthogonal to the set $C$ at the projection point.

## Visual Understanding

![Projection 1.png](/img/user/assets/Projection%201.png)
Here the distance between $x$ and $P_C(x)$ is <strong><span style="color: var(--color-cyan);">minimized</span></strong>, making $P_C(x)$ the <strong><span style="color: var(--color-pink);">closest point</span></strong> in the convex set $C$.

![Projection 2.png](/img/user/assets/Projection%202.png)
Here the **inner product condition** confirms that the projection direction is **perpendicular** to the tangent at $P_C(x)$. Thus, the inner product is <strong><span style="color: var(--color-red);">non-positive</span></strong>.

> [!info] Remember:
> This stuff: $\color{var(--color-yellow)}{(y - P_C(y))(x - P_C(y))}$ is the same as $\color{var(--color-aqua)}{\langle y - P_C(y), \, x - P_C(y) \rangle}$.

These visualizations emphasize that projection always **follows the shortest path** to the set.
