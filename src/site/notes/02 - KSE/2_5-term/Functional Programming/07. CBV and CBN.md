# CBV and CBN

## Call by Value vs. Call by Name: Which One is Faster?

Now that we understand evaluation strategies, let’s explore the two primary approaches:

- **Call by Value (CBV)**: Evaluate arguments **before** calling the function.
- **Call by Name (CBN)**: Delay evaluating arguments **until they are actually needed** inside the function.

To make this comparison concrete, let’s analyze the function given in the slide:

```scala
def test(x: Int, y: Int) = x * x
```

This function **only uses `x`** — the parameter `y` is completely ignored.

Now, let’s evaluate different function calls using **CBV and CBN** and see which is faster.

## Understanding the Key Difference

- **Call by Value** (CBV):

  - First, **evaluate all arguments** before executing the function.
  - Replace function parameters with **precomputed values**.
  - Arguments are evaluated **only once**.

- **Call by Name** (CBN):
  - Function arguments **are not evaluated immediately**.
  - Instead, they are substituted **as is** and only computed **when needed** inside the function.
  - If an argument is **never used**, it is **never evaluated**.

This means that **if an argument is expensive to compute and not needed**, Call by Name can **save time** by skipping unnecessary computations.
