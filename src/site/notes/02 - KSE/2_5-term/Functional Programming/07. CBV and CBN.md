# CBV and CBN

---

## Call by Value vs. Call by Name: Which One is Faster?

Now that we understand evaluation strategies, let’s explore the two primary approaches:

- **Call by Value (CBV)**: Evaluate arguments **before** calling the function.
- **Call by Name (CBN)**: Delay evaluating arguments **until they are actually needed** inside the function.

To make this comparison concrete, let’s analyze the function given in the slide:

```scala
def test(x: Int, y: Int): Int =
  x * x
```

This function **only uses `x`** — the parameter `y` is completely ignored.

Now, let’s evaluate different function calls using **CBV and CBN** and see which is faster.

---

## Understanding the Key Difference

- **Call by Value** (CBV):

  - First, **evaluate all arguments** before executing the function.
  - Replace function parameters with **precomputed values**.
  - Arguments are evaluated **only once**.

- **Call by Name** (CBN):
  - Function arguments **are not evaluated immediately**.
  - Instead, they are substituted **as is** and only computed **when needed** inside the function.
  - If an argument is **never used**, it is **never evaluated**.

This means that **if an argument is expensive to compute and not needed**, Call by Name can **save time** by skipping unnecessary computations.

---

## Evaluating Function Calls

```scala
test(2, 3)
```

- **Call by Value**:
  - we do not have expressions to evaluate, so we can directly substitute `2` for `x` and `3` for `y`.
  - Compute `x * x` immediately.
  - Result: `4`.

```scala
test(2, 3)
→ 2 * 2
→ 4
```

- **Call by Name**:
  - in the body of the function, we only use `x`, so we ignore `y`.
  - compute `x * x` only when needed (immediately in this case).
  - Result: `4`.

```scala
test(2, 3)
→ 2 * 2
→ 4
```

So, in this case, **both CBV and CBN** produce the same result... but what if we had a more complex function?

---

```scala
test(6 + 9, 8)
```

- **Call by Value**:
  - First, evaluate all arguments **before** calling the function.
  - Compute `6 + 9 = 15` and `8` remains `8`.
  - Now substitute `x = 15` into `x * x` and compute.

```scala
test(6 + 9, 8)
→ test(15, 8)  // argument (6 + 9) evaluated before function call
→ 15 * 15
→ 225
```

- **Call by Name**:
  - The function body only uses `x`, so `y` is ignored.
  - Instead of computing `6 + 9` before calling the function, we **substitute the expression as is**.
  - Only when `x` is used in `x * x`, do we compute `6 + 9`.

```scala
test(6 + 9, 8)
→ (6 + 9) * (6 + 9)  // argument is substituted directly
→ 15 * (6 + 9)
→ 15 * 15
→ 225
```

- **Key Difference**:
  - CBV **computes `6 + 9` once** before calling the function.
  - CBN **computes `6 + 9` twice**, because it substitutes `(6 + 9)` directly into `x * x`.

✅ **CBV is more efficient here** because it avoids redundant calculations.

---

```scala
test(4, 2 * 10)
```

- **Call by Value**:
  - Evaluate arguments **before** calling the function.
  - Compute `2 * 10 = 20` and substitute `x = 4`.

```scala
test(4, 2 * 10)
→ test(4, 20)  // Arguments evaluated before function call
→ 4 * 4
→ 16
```

- **Call by Name**:
  - The function **never uses `y`**, so `2 * 10` **is never evaluated**.
  - Simply substitute `x = 4`, and compute `4 * 4`.

```scala
test(4, 2 * 10)
→ 4 * 4
→ 16
```

- **Key Difference**:
  - CBV **computes `2 * 10` unnecessarily**, even though it is never used.
  - CBN **skips evaluating `y` entirely**, saving unnecessary computation.

✅ **CBN is more efficient here** because it avoids computing `2 * 10`, which is not needed.

---

```scala
test(3 + 2, 4 * 3)
```

- **Call by Value**:
  - Compute both arguments **before** calling the function.
  - Compute `3 + 2 = 5` and `4 * 3 = 12`.
  - Substitute `x = 5` and compute.

```scala
test(3 + 2, 4 * 3)
→ test(5, 4 * 3)
→ test(5, 12)  // arguments evaluated before function call
→ 5 * 5
→ 25
```

- **Call by Name**:
  - `x` is used in `x * x`, so **we delay evaluating `3 + 2`**.
  - Instead of computing `3 + 2` before calling the function, **we substitute `(3 + 2)` directly**.
  - `y` is not used, so `4 * 3` **is ignored**.

```scala
test(3 + 2, 4 * 3)
→ (3 + 2) * (3 + 2)  // argument is substituted directly
→ 5 * (3 + 2)
→ 5 * 5
→ 25
```

- **Key Difference**:
  - CBV **computes both `3 + 2` and `4 * 3` before calling the function**.
  - CBN **computes `3 + 2` twice**, but **skips evaluating `4 * 3` entirely**.

✅ **Both strategies are equally efficient** in this case.

## One more example

The previous examples focused on pure functions where evaluation order only affected performance. But what happens when a function has **side effects**, such as printing output? This is where the difference between **Call by Value** (CBV) and **Call by Name** (CBN) becomes even more obvious.

Let’s define a simple function that prints something when called and returns an `Int`:

```scala
def something(): Int = {
  println("calling something")
  1
}
```

Now, we define two functions that accept an `Int` argument:

- `callByValue` uses **Call by Value** (`x: Int`).
- `callByName` uses **Call by Name** (`x: ⇒ Int`).

```scala
def callByValue(x: Int) = {
  println("x1=" + x)
  println("x2=" + x)
}

// note the `⇒` syntax for CBN!
def callByName(x: ⇒ Int) = { 
  println("x1=" + x)
  println("x2=" + x)
}
```

Now, let’s see what happens when we call them with `something()`.

### Call by Value

```scala
callByValue(something())
```

**Output:**

```
calling something
x1=1
x2=1
```

- **`something()` is evaluated before calling `callByValue`**.
- The return value (`1`) is passed into `x`.
- Both `println` statements use the same precomputed value.

### Call by Name

```scala
callByName(something())
```

**Output:**

```
calling something
x1=1
calling something
x2=1
```

- **`something()` is evaluated each time `x` is used**.
- Since `x` appears twice in the function body, the side effect (printing) happens **twice**.
- The value of `x` is recomputed every time it's accessed.

### Key Takeaways:

- **Call by Value** **evaluates arguments once** before calling the function, making it more efficient when an argument is used multiple times.
- **Call by Name** **recomputes the argument every time it's used**, which can lead to unnecessary repeated work and side effects.
- If the argument involves **side effects** (e.g., printing or modifying a variable), CBN can cause <strong><span style="color: var(--color-red);">unexpected behavior</span></strong>.

This example demonstrates why understanding **when arguments are evaluated** is crucial, especially when dealing with functions that produce side effects.
