# Free and bounded variables
---

In Lambda Calculus, variables can be **free** or **bound**, which is fundamental for understanding how functions work. Let’s break down what that means.

## Definition of Free Variables

A variable is **free** if it’s **not restricted** by any function ([[02 - KSE/2_5-term/Functional Programming/02. Definition of λ-term\|λ-abstraction]]). In simpler terms, a free variable is like an **independent traveler** — it’s not tied to any specific function.

### Formal Definition

The set of **free variables** of a λ-term $M$, denoted as $FV(M)$, is defined inductively:

1. **For a variable:**
   $$
   FV(x) = \{ x \}
   $$
   This means that the variable $x$ is free when it stands alone.

2. **For an application:**
   $$
   FV(M \, N) = FV(M) \cup FV(N)
   $$
   The free variables of an application are the union of the free variables in both $M$ and $N$.

3. **For an abstraction:**
   $$
   FV(\lambda x. M) = FV(M) \setminus \{ x \}
   $$
   Here, the variable $x$ becomes **bound** by the λ, so it’s no longer free within $M$.

---

## Definition of Bound Variables

A variable is **bound** if it **falls under the scope of a λ-abstraction**. It’s like a **worker bound to a contract** — they can’t act freely outside the company’s rules.

- A variable $x$ in $M$ is **bound** if it appears after $\lambda x$.
- If it’s not bound, it’s considered **free**.

### Example:

- **Bound Variable:** In $\lambda x. (x + y)$, the variable $x$ is **bound** because it’s declared inside the λ.  
- **Free Variable:** The variable $y$ is **free** because it’s not tied to any λ-abstraction.

---

## Examples to Illustrate Free and Bound Variables

### Example 1: Simple Abstraction

- **Lambda Calculus:** $\lambda x. x$
- **Free Variables:** $FV(\lambda x. x) = FV(x) \setminus \{ x \} = \emptyset$
- **Python Equivalent:**
  ```python
  identity = lambda x: x
  print(identity(5))  # Output: 5
  ```
  
Here, `x` is bound inside the lambda function.

---

### Example 2: Mixed Free and Bound Variables

- **Lambda Calculus:** $\lambda x. (x + y)$
- **Free Variables:** $FV(\lambda x. (x + y)) = FV(x + y) \setminus \{ x \} = \{ y \}$
- **Python Equivalent:**
  ```python
  y = 10  # Free variable
  add_y = lambda x: x + y  # x is bound, y is free
  print(add_y(5))  # Output: 15
  ```

---

### Example 3: Nested Abstraction

- **Lambda Calculus:** $\lambda x. (\lambda y. (x + y + z))$
- **Free Variables:** 
  $$
  FV(\lambda x. (\lambda y. (x + y + z))) = FV(\lambda y. (x + y + z)) \setminus \{ x \}
  $$
  Breaking it down:
  - $FV(\lambda y. (x + y + z)) = \{ x, z \}$
  - Removing $x$: $\{ z \}$

- **Python Equivalent:**
  ```python
  z = 3  # Free variable
  func = lambda x: (lambda y: x + y + z)  # x and y are bound, z is free
  print(func(2)(4))  # Output: 9
  ```

---

## Closed λ-terms (Combinators)

A λ-term is **closed** if it has **no free variables**. These are also known as **combinators**.

### Definition:
$$
FV(M) = \emptyset \quad \Rightarrow \quad M \text{ is closed}
$$
The set of all closed λ-terms is denoted by $\Lambda_0$.

### Example:

- **Closed Term:** $\lambda x. x$ (no free variables)
- **Not Closed:** $\lambda x. (x + y)$ (free variable $y$)

- **Python Equivalent (Closed Term):**
  ```python
  identity = lambda x: x  # Closed, no external variables
  print(identity(100))  # Output: 100
  ```

- **Python Equivalent (Not Closed):**
  ```python
  y = 50  # Free variable
  add_y = lambda x: x + y  # Not closed
  print(add_y(20))  # Output: 70
  ```

---

## Standard Combinators

In Lambda Calculus, **combinators** are special λ-terms with **no free variables** — they’re entirely self-contained. These combinators act as the foundational "building blocks" for constructing complex expressions. The three most important combinators are:

1. **Identity Combinator (I)**
2. **Constant Combinator (K)**
3. **Substitution Combinator (S)**

Let’s break down each of these with detailed explanations and Python equivalents.

---

### 1. Identity Combinator (I)

#### Definition:
$$
I = \lambda x. x
$$

The **Identity Combinator** simply returns whatever you give it. It’s like holding up a mirror — the output is exactly the same as the input.

#### Step-by-Step:
- Applying $I$ to any value $A$:
  $$
  I \, A = (\lambda x. x) \, A \rightarrow A
  $$
- In other words, $I$ **does nothing special** — it just returns the argument unchanged.

#### Python Equivalent:
```python
# Identity function
I = lambda x: x
print(I(42))       # Output: 42
print(I("Lambda")) # Output: Lambda
```

- **Explanation:** Here, `I` takes an input (`42` or `"Lambda"`) and simply returns it without modification.

---

### 2. Constant Combinator (K)

#### Definition:
$$
K = \lambda x. \lambda y. x
$$
or more compactly:
$$
K = \lambda x\, y. x
$$

The **Constant Combinator** takes **two arguments** but always **returns the first one**, completely ignoring the second. It’s like asking someone their favorite food, and they always answer "Pizza," no matter what else you offer.

#### Step-by-Step:
- Applying $K$ to two arguments $A$ and $B$:
  $$
  K \, A \, B = (\lambda x. \lambda y. x) \, A \, B
  $$
  1. Apply $A$: 
     $$
     (\lambda y. A)
     $$
  2. Apply $B$:
     $$
     A
     $$
- No matter what $B$ is, you always get $A$ back.

#### Python Equivalent:
```python
# Constant combinator
K = lambda x: (lambda y: x)
print(K(10)(20))    # Output: 10
print(K("First")("Second"))  # Output: First
```

- **Explanation:** `K(10)` returns a function that **ignores** its argument (`20` in this case) and always returns `10`. The same applies to strings.

---

### 3. Substitution Combinator (S)

#### Definition:
$$
S = \lambda x. \lambda y. \lambda z. (x \, z) (y \, z)
$$
or:
$$
S = \lambda x\, y\, z. (x(z))(y(z))
$$

The **Substitution Combinator** is more complex. It:
1. **Applies** the same argument $z$ to both functions $x$ and $y$.
2. Then **applies the result** of $x(z)$ to the result of $y(z)$.

Think of it like:
- Sending the same **input** ($z$) to two different **machines** ($x$ and $y$).
- Taking the **outputs** of both machines and combining them.

#### Step-by-Step:

- Applying $S$ to $x$, $y$, and $z$:
  $$
  S \, x \, y \, z = (x(z))(y(z))
  $$
- This means:
  - **`x(z)`** must return a **function**.
  - **`y(z)`** provides the **input** to that function.

#### Python Equivalent:
```python
# Substitution combinator
S = lambda x: (lambda y: (lambda z: x(z)(y(z))))

# Example functions:
x = lambda z: (lambda w: z + w)  # Returns a function that adds z to w
y = lambda z: z * 2              # Doubles z
z = 5

# Apply the substitution combinator
result = S(x)(y)(z)
print(result)  # Output: 15
```

#### How This Works:

1. **First Application:** 
   ```python
   x(5) → lambda w: 5 + w
   ```
2. **Second Application:** 
   ```python
   y(5) → 10
   ```
3. **Final Application:** 
   ```python
   (lambda w: 5 + w)(10) → 15
   ```

- **Summary:** The input `5` is processed by both `x` and `y`, and their results are combined.

## Substitution Rules

**Substitution** is the process of replacing a variable in a λ-term with another term. This is fundamental for **reducing** and **evaluating** λ-expressions.

### Formal Substitution Notation:
$$
[N / x] M
$$
- This means: **“Substitute $N$ for $x$ in $M$.”**

### Substitution Rules:

1. **Direct Substitution:**
   $$
   [N / x] x = N
   $$
   - Replace $x$ with $N$ directly.

2. **Irrelevant Variable:**
   $$
   [N / x] a = a \quad \text{(if } a \neq x \text{)}
   $$
   - If $a$ is not $x$, leave it unchanged.

3. **Application Rule:**
   $$
   [N / x](P \, Q) = ([N / x] P) ([N / x] Q)
   $$
   - Apply substitution to both $P$ and $Q$.

4. **Abstraction (Bound Variable is the Same):**
   $$
   [N / x](\lambda x. P) = \lambda x. P
   $$
   - No substitution occurs because $x$ is **bound** in $\lambda x. P$.

5. **Abstraction (Bound Variable is Different):**
   $$
   [N / x](\lambda y. P) = \lambda y. [N / x] P \quad \text{if } y \neq x
   $$
   - Apply substitution **inside** the abstraction if it doesn’t bind $x$.

---

## Example: Substitution in Action

### Lambda Calculus Example

Substitute $y$ for $x$ in:
$$
[y / x](\lambda x. (x + z)) = \lambda x. (x + z)
$$
- **Why no change?**  
  $x$ is **bound** by the λ, so the substitution does not affect it.

### Python Equivalent:
```python
# Bound variable: substitution doesn't affect 'x'
z = 5
func = lambda x: x + z  # x is bound inside the lambda
print(func(10))         # Output: 15
```

---

### Substitution with Free Variables

Now, substituting **outside** the scope:
$$
[y / x](\lambda w. (x + w)) = \lambda w. (y + w)
$$

#### Python Equivalent:
```python
# Free variable: substitution affects 'x'
x = 7  # Free variable
expr = lambda y: x + y  # 'x' is free here
print(expr(3))          # Output: 10
```

- **Explanation:** Here, `x` is a **free variable**, so changing it affects the result.

---

## Final Thoughts

1. **Identity Combinator (I):** Returns its argument unchanged.  
   - Python: `lambda x: x`

2. **Constant Combinator (K):** Always returns the first argument, ignoring the second.  
   - Python: `lambda x: (lambda y: x)`

3. **Substitution Combinator (S):** Applies the same argument to two functions and combines the results.  
   - Python: `lambda x: (lambda y: (lambda z: x(z)(y(z))))`

### Key Concepts:

- **Free Variables:** Like global variables in programming — accessible anywhere.
- **Bound Variables:** Like local variables — limited to specific scopes (inside functions).
- **Closed Terms (Combinators):** Functions without free variables — completely self-contained.
- **Substitution:** The process of replacing variables to simplify or evaluate expressions.
