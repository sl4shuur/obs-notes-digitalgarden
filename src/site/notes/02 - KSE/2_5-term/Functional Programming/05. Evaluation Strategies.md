# Evaluation Strategies

## Understanding Evaluation Strategies

Before diving into CBV and CBN, let’s step back and understand **why** evaluation strategies matter.

When a function is called in a programming language, **how and when** its arguments are evaluated can affect:

- **Performance** (do we compute things too early or too often?).
- **Correctness** (do we compute things in the right order?).
- **Termination** (will the program ever stop running?).

Expressions specified by methods are calculated in the same way as operators:

1. **Evaluate all function arguments** in a specific order. i.e., from left to right.
2. **Replace the function name** with its definition.
3. **Substitute the argument values** for the function’s parameters.
4. **Compute the result** step by step.

This is known as **function application**, and it follows a structured process. To make this more concrete, let’s break down an example.

---

### Example

Consider the function:

```scala
def sumOfSquares(x: Double, y: Double): Double = square(x) + square(y)
```

And let’s evaluate the expression:

```scala
sumOfSquares(3, 2 + 2)
```

At first glance, this might seem trivial, but the **order** in which we evaluate things makes a **huge difference**. Let’s go step by step.

---

#### Step 1: Expanding the Function Definition

We replace the function call with its definition:

```
sumOfSquares(3, 2 + 2)
→ square(3) + square(2 + 2)
```

At this stage, **we have a choice**:

- Do we evaluate `2 + 2` first?
- Or do we keep `2 + 2` as is and evaluate `square` first?

This choice defines **how the evaluation strategy works**.

---

#### Step 2: Expanding the First Function Call

Let’s focus on `square(3)`:

```scala
def square(x: Double): Double = x * x
```

So,

```
square(3) + square(2 + 2)
→ (3 * 3) + square(2 + 2)
→ 9 + square(2 + 2)
```

At this stage, **we still haven’t evaluated `2 + 2` yet**. Again, the question arises:

- Should we compute `2 + 2 = 4` now?
- Or should we delay it until we actually need the value?

---

#### Step 3: Expanding the Second Function Call

Now, let’s expand `square(2 + 2)`:

```
9 + square(2 + 2)
→ 9 + ((2 + 2) * (2 + 2))
```

If we now compute `2 + 2`:

```
9 + (4 * 4)
```

And finally:

```
9 + 16
→ 25
```

At this point, we’ve completed our evaluation — but notice something interesting:  
We **delayed evaluating `2 + 2`** until the very last moment when it was absolutely necessary.

---

### Changing the evaluation strategy

So we still have the same function:

```scala
def sumOfSquares(x: Double, y: Double): Double = square(x) + square(y)

// calculate the sum of squares
sumOfSquares(3, 2 + 2)
```

But now, let’s evaluate it with a different strategy:

#### Reducing arguments first

We had a choice in the previous example:

- Do we evaluate `2 + 2` first?
- Or do we keep `2 + 2` as is and evaluate `square` first?

This time, let’s **evaluate `2 + 2` first**!

```scala
sumOfSquares(3, 2 + 2)
→ sumOfSquares(3, 4)
```

#### Expanding the function

Now, we expand the function:

```scala
sumOfSquares(3, 4)
→ square(3) + square(4)
```

#### Performing the calculations

Finally, we calculate the squares:

```scala
square(3) + square(4)
→ 9 + 16
→ 25
```

By evaluating `2 + 2` first, we were able to **reduce the expression** to a simpler form. So why we can’t always do this?

---

## Why Does This Matter?

This example may look straightforward, but what if:

- The argument involves **complex calculations** instead of `2 + 2`?
- The argument is **an infinite loop**? (e.g., `while(true) {}`).
- The argument **is never actually used** in the function?

Depending on **how we choose to evaluate arguments**, these scenarios could either be **efficient and correct** or **cause serious performance issues — or even non-termination**.

Evaluation strategies determine **when** computations happen and **whether they happen at all**. This is the foundation of **function application**, and it’s the key to understanding different ways languages handle execution.

From here, we can now explore the two main strategies:  
**Call by Name** (delay computation until needed) and **Call by Value** (compute first, use later). And this stuff will be crucial as we dive deeper into functional programming concepts. It can explain **what happens when an argument is an infinite computation?**
