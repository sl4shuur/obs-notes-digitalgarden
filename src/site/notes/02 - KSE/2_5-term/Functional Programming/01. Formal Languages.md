## Introduction to Formal Languages and Lambda Calculus

### Key Concepts Introduced by Noam Chomsky

Noam Chomsky developed a theory of **formal languages**, which classifies languages into four categories based on their complexity and the type of automata that recognize them.

### The Chomsky Hierarchy: Language Classes

1. **Regular Languages (Type 3)**

   - Recognized by **deterministic finite automata (DFA)**.
   - Defined using **regular expressions**.
   - **Limitations:**
     - Can only describe simple patterns (e.g., sequences, repetitions).
     - Lack the power to express nested or hierarchical structures.
   - <strong><span style="color: var(--color-green);">Example</span></strong>: Identifying whether a string contains "ab" using a _regular expression_.

2. **Context-Free Languages (Type 2)**

   - Recognized by **non-deterministic pushdown automata (PDA)**.
   - Most **programming languages** fall under this category.
   - Defined using **context-free grammars (CFG)**.
   - **Recognition Process:**
     - Given a string, an algorithm determines if it belongs to the language.
     - Involves parsing strategies with varying complexity.
   - <strong><span style="color: var(--color-green);">Example:</span></strong> Arithmetic expressions with balanced parentheses. Parsing HTML or XML.

3. **Context-Sensitive Languages (Type 1)**

   - Recognized by **bounded Turing machines**, where the tape is limited in both directions.
   - More powerful than context-free grammars but computationally expensive.
   - <strong><span style="color: var(--color-green);">Example:</span></strong> Grammar rules where production depends on surrounding symbols. Natural language processing (NLP) requiring context-sensitive grammar.

4. **Recursively Enumerable Languages (Type 0)**
   - Recognized by **Turing machines** with unlimited tape.
   - The most general and powerful type, covering all computable languages.
   - <strong><span style="color: var(--color-green);">Example:</span></strong> Any problem solvable by a computer with no constraints. AI computations.

### The Role of Recursion in Language Definition

- **Recursion** is the backbone of language definition and recognition.
- Recursion is believed to be an inherent feature of **human cognition**, making natural languages potentially describable by Turing machines.
- Formal grammars often rely on recursive structures to describe complex patterns.

### Defining Grammars with Backus-Naur Form (BNF)

BNF is a formal notation used to define the syntax of programming languages through recursion.

**Example: Defining Numbers Using BNF**

```bnf
<digit> ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | ... | 9
<number> ::= <digit> | <digit><number>
```

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-aqua);">Interpretation:</span></strong>

- A number can be a single digit or a digit followed by another number.
- Recursive expansion allows generating multi-digit numbers.

**Key Point:**  
To prevent infinite recursion, a **base case** is essential (e.g., defining the digit separately).

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-red);">Bad Example: Incorrect BNF Definition</span></strong>

```bnf
<number> ::= <number><digit>
```

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-aqua);">Why is this incorrect?</span></strong>

- **Missing base case:** This definition lacks a non-recursive base case, causing an infinite recursion when trying to derive a number.
- **Evaluation issue:** Parsing a number would require infinite lookahead without reaching a termination point.
- **Example of failure:**
  - If we start with `<number>`, it expands to `<number><digit>`, which again expands to `<number><digit>`, leading to an infinite loop.

**Correcting the Issue:**  
To fix this, the [[02 - KSE/2_5-term/Functional Programming/01. Formal Languages#Defining Grammars with Backus-Naur Form (BNF)\|definition]] should include a termination condition by allowing `<number>` to be a single `<digit>` without further recursion.

### Application of Formal Grammars in Programming Languages

- Programming languages like **Scala** and **Python** use context-free grammars (CFG).
- BNF and Extended BNF (EBNF) are widely adopted in compiler design to describe syntax.

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-green);">Example:</span></strong>
The syntax of Scala can be fully described using BNF notation, highlighting the flexibility of context-free grammars.

### BNF in Programming Language Syntax

- Programming languages like **Scala and Python** define their syntax using BNF or Extended BNF (EBNF).
- <strong><span style="color: var(--color-green);">Example (Python BNF syntax fragment):</span></strong>
  ```
  <expression> ::= <term> "+" <expression> | <term>
  <term> ::= <factor> "*" <term> | <factor>
  <factor> ::= "(" <expression> ")" | <digit>
  ```

**Key Takeaways:**

- The BNF representation allows developers to formally describe the structure of expressions, statements, and blocks.
- Many programming language compilers and interpreters rely on CFGs and BNF to parse source code efficiently.

## Introduction to Lambda Calculus

---

### What is Lambda Calculus?

Lambda calculus is a **formal system** in mathematical logic and computer science for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application. It serves as the foundation for functional programming languages and provides a simple yet powerful model of computation.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Treats functions as first-class entities.
- Avoids mutable state and imperative control flow.
- Relies on **function application** as the primary means of computation.

### Historical Background

Lambda calculus was introduced by **Alonzo Church** in the 1930s as a foundation for formalizing computation. It was initially developed as part of an attempt to understand the nature of functions and mathematical logic.

**Real-World Impact:**

- Forms the theoretical underpinning of languages such as **Haskell**, **Scala**, and **Lisp**.
- Provides insights into functional programming paradigms such as **higher-order functions** and **immutability**.
