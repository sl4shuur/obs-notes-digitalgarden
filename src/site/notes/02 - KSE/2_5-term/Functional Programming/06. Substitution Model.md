# Substitution Model

## The Substitution Model: The Core of Functional Evaluation

When we evaluate an expression, what’s really happening? **The substitution model** gives us a structured way to think about computation: instead of executing instructions step by step, we **replace expressions with their values** until we reach a final result.

This idea is fundamental in **functional programming**, where functions behave **like mathematical expressions**—they always return the same output for the same input and have no hidden side effects.

The substitution model can be applied to **all expressions that do not have side effects**, making computations **more predictable and easier to reason about**.

But what exactly happens when we apply substitution? Let’s break it down.

---

### How the Substitution Model Works

At its core, **substitution shortens computation** by systematically replacing expressions with their evaluated values.

Consider a simple function:

```scala
def addOne(x: Int) = x + 1
```

Now, evaluating:

```scala
addOne(4)
```

**Step-by-step substitution:**

1. Replace the function call with its definition:

   ```
   4 + 1
   ```

2. Compute the result:

   ```
   5
   ```

This model guarantees that **evaluation is consistent**—no matter where you call `addOne(4)`, it will always produce `5` without side effects.

However, **not all languages** follow this clean substitution model. **Imperative** languages, like <strong><span style="color: var(--color-blue);">C++</span></strong>, introduce **complications**.

---

## The Problem of Side Effects: Why Substitution Fails in Imperative Languages

In pure functional programming, substitution works perfectly because **expressions only compute values and do nothing else**.

But what if a function **modifies a variable** while computing a value? This is called a **side effect**, and it **breaks the substitution model**.

### Example: Why Substitution Fails in C++

A classic example of a **side effect** is the increment operation in C++:

```cpp
int x = 5;
int y = x++;
```

What happens here?

1. The expression `x++` does **two things**:

   - It **returns** the current value of `x` (which is `5`).
   - It **modifies** `x`, increasing it to `6`.

```cpp
std::cout << x << std::endl; // Output: 6
std::cout << y << std::endl; // Output: 5
```


2. Now, `y` is assigned **the old value** (`5`), and `x` has changed to `6`.

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-aqua);">Why can’t we substitute?</span></strong>
If we tried to substitute `x++` with its value, we’d be stuck:

```
y = (x = x + 1)
```

This **doesn’t work** because the operation **changes `x` while evaluating `y`**. The substitution model assumes that replacing an expression with its value **does not alter anything else**, but in C++, this assumption **breaks down**.

### The Need for an Intermediate Storage Mechanism

Since `x++` both **returns a value and modifies a variable**, languages like C++ must **store intermediate states** to keep track of both the computation and its side effects.

This is why **functional languages avoid mutable state** — when every function **only returns a value**, substitution works **flawlessly**, making programs easier to understand and debug.

## Termination: Does Every Computation Reach a Final Result?

A fundamental question in any evaluation strategy is:  
**Does every expression eventually reduce to a final value?**

In most cases, yes. But sometimes, **a computation may never stop**.

### Example: A Function That Never Terminates

Consider the following recursive function:

```scala
def loop: Int = loop
```

Now, if we evaluate:

```scala
loop
```

What happens?

1. Replace `loop` with its definition:

   ```
   loop
   ```

2. Replace `loop` again:

   ```
   loop
   ```

3. **This never ends!** The function keeps calling itself forever.

This is known as **non-termination**, and it’s a **huge problem** for programs.

---

## Why Termination Matters

Understanding termination is crucial because:

1. **Some functions are guaranteed to terminate** (e.g., `3 + 4` will always compute `7`).
2. **Some functions might never terminate** (like `loop` above).
3. **Some evaluation strategies can help avoid unnecessary infinite loops**.

For example, if an argument **never needs to be evaluated**, we might be able to **skip executing an infinite loop entirely**—this is where different **evaluation strategies** (like **Call by Value** and **Call by Name**) come into play.

---

## The Big Takeaway

- **The substitution model** allows expressions to be evaluated in a structured, step-by-step manner, **as long as there are no side effects**.
- **Imperative languages (like C++) introduce side effects**, which break substitution and require additional mechanisms to track state changes.
- **Not all expressions terminate**—some functions, like infinite loops, will never reach a final value.
- **Choosing the right evaluation strategy** can sometimes help us avoid computing things that would otherwise run forever.

This brings us to the **next major question**:  
**Should we evaluate everything immediately, or only when needed?**

This is the foundation of **Call by Value vs. Call by Name**, which we’ll explore next.
