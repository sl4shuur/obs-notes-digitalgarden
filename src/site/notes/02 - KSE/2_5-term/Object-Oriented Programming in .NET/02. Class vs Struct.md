# Class vs Struct
---

## Introduction to Classes
---

A **class** in C# is a **reference type**, meaning that variables of this type store **references (memory addresses)** to objects rather than the actual object itself. It means that when a class is instantiated, memory is allocated to store the object's data.

When a class is declared:
- By default, its value is **null** until an instance is explicitly created using the `new` keyword.
- Alternatively, an object from another compatible type can be assigned.

When you define a class, you are essentially defining a new data type that can have **properties (data)** and **methods (functions)** associated with it.

### Key Points
1. **Reference Type**
   - A class is a **reference type**, meaning that when an instance of a class (an object) is created, the variable holding it does **not** contain the actual data. Instead, it holds a **reference (or memory address)** to where the data is stored in memory.

2. **Memory Allocation**
   - When you instantiate a class using the `new` keyword, memory is allocated on the **heap** to store the object's data. The variable used to access this object holds a **reference** to this memory location.

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-green);">Example</span></strong>
```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

// Creating an instance of the Person class
Person person1 = new Person();
person1.Name = "Alice";
person1.Age = 30;

// Creating another reference to the same object
Person person2 = person1;

// Modifying the object through the second reference
person2.Age = 35;

// Both person1 and person2 refer to the same object
Console.WriteLine(person1.Age); // Output: 35
Console.WriteLine(person2.Age); // Output: 35
```

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-aqua);">Explanation:</span></strong>
- `Person` is a class.
- `person1` and `person2` are variables that hold **references** to the same `Person` object.
- Changing the `Age` property through `person2` also affects `person1` because both variables refer to the **same object in memory**.

This behavior differs from **value types** (like `int`, `float`, `struct`), where the variable **holds the actual data**, and copying the variable creates a **new copy** of the data.

Understanding this distinction is crucial for **managing memory** and avoiding unintended side effects in your programs.

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-purple);">Metaphor:</span></strong> 
A **class** is like an architectural blueprint for a house. The blueprint itself does not take up space, but once a house is built (instantiated), it occupies a physical location.

### Practical Applications
Classes are beneficial when dealing with:

- **Large objects** that require complex operations.

- **Shared state**, where multiple parts of an application need to interact with the same data.
  - <strong><span style="color: var(--color-green);">Example</span></strong>: in games, a `Player` class might store the player's health, position, and other attributes.

- **[[02 - KSE/2_5-term/Object-Oriented Programming in .NET/01. Intro to OOP#Inheritance\|Inheritance]]**, which allows code reuse and extension of existing functionality.
  - <strong><span style="color: var(--color-green);">Example</span></strong>: a `Vehicle` class might be inherited by `Car`, `Truck`, and `Motorcycle` classes, which share common properties and methods.

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-green);">Example Use Case:</span></strong>  
In an e-commerce system, a `Customer` class might be used to represent shoppers, containing attributes like `Name`, `Email`, and methods such as `PlaceOrder()`.
### Key Considerations
- Classes support **[[02 - KSE/2_5-term/Object-Oriented Programming in .NET/01. Intro to OOP#Inheritance\|inheritance]]**, making them suitable for scenarios where multiple related entities share behavior.
- As a reference type, a class variable stores a memory address rather than the actual object, meaning improper handling can lead to **null reference exceptions** if not instantiated properly.

## Introduction to Structs
---

A **struct** in C# is a **value type**, meaning that variables of this type hold the actual data rather than a reference to an object in memory.

### Key Points
1. **Value Type**
   - Unlike classes, structs store their **actual data** directly in the variable, not a reference.
   - When a struct is assigned to another variable, a **copy** of the data is made, meaning the two variables operate independently.

2. **Memory Allocation**
   - Structs are allocated on the **stack**, which provides faster access compared to heap allocation.
   - They are suitable for small, short-lived objects that do not require complex behavior.

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-green);">Example</span></strong>
```csharp
public struct Point
{
    public int X { get; set; }
    public int Y { get; set; }
}

// Creating an instance of the struct
Point point1 = new Point();
point1.X = 10;
point1.Y = 20;

// Copying struct data to another variable
Point point2 = point1;

// Modifying the copied struct
point2.X = 50;

// Original struct remains unchanged
Console.WriteLine(point1.X); // Output: 10
Console.WriteLine(point2.X); // Output: 50
```

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-aqua);">Explanation:</span></strong>
- `Point` is a struct.
- `point1` and `point2` are separate **copies**, meaning changes made to one do **not** affect the other.
- Structs behave similarly to primitive types like `int` and `float` in terms of memory management.

---

### When to Use Structs
Structs are ideal for:

- **Small data models**, such as coordinates, colors, and dimensions.
- **Performance-critical applications**, where avoiding heap allocation is beneficial.
- **Immutable objects**, where the state should not change after creation.
- **Simple entities**, which do not require inheritance or complex behaviors.

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-green);">Example Use Case:</span></strong>  
In a graphics application, a `Color` struct might be used to represent RGB values efficiently without unnecessary overhead.

---

### Key Considerations
- **No inheritance**: Structs cannot inherit from other structs or classes.
- **Efficient memory use**: They can lead to better performance in cases with frequent object creation and disposal.
- **Copy behavior**: Since structs are copied when assigned, careful consideration is needed to avoid unintended data duplication.

## Differences Between Classes and Structs
---

Understanding the fundamental differences between **classes** and **structs** in C# is essential for making the right design decisions when developing applications.

| Feature               | Class (Reference Type)                               | Struct (Value Type)                           |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Memory Allocation** | Allocated on the **heap**, accessed via reference    | Allocated on the **stack**, holds actual data |
| **Copy Behavior**     | Copies reference (points to the same object)         | Creates a new copy of the entire object       |
| **Performance**       | Slower due to heap allocation and garbage collection | Faster for small data due to stack allocation |
| **Inheritance**       | Supports inheritance ✅                               | Does not support inheritance ❌                |
| **Mutability**        | Mutable by default                                   | Can be made immutable easily                  |
| **Usage**             | Best for complex objects with shared state           | Best for small, lightweight objects           |

### Mutability in Classes and Structs

Mutability refers to whether or not the **state (data)** of an object can be *changed* after it is created.

#### Key Points:
1. **Mutable by Default (Classes)**
   - In C#, **class instances** are mutable by default, meaning their properties and fields can be modified after creation without any special effort.
     
   - <strong><span style="color: var(--color-green);">Example</span></strong>:
     ```csharp
     public class Person
     {
         public string Name { get; set; }
         public int Age { get; set; }
     }

     Person person1 = new Person { Name = "Alice", Age = 30 };
     Console.WriteLine(person1.Age);  // Output: 30
     
     person1.Age = 35;  // The object's state is modified
     Console.WriteLine(person1.Age);  // Output: 35
     ```
   - Since classes are reference types, multiple references to the same object can result in **unintended side effects**, as all references will reflect any changes made.

2. **Can Be Made Immutable Easily (Structs)**
   - Structs in C# can be made immutable by using the `readonly` modifier for fields and properties, ensuring their state **cannot** be changed after creation.
   - <strong><span style="color: var(--color-green);">Example</span></strong>:
     ```csharp
     public struct Point
     {
         public readonly int X { get; }
         public readonly int Y { get; }

         public Point(int x, int y)
         {
             X = x;
             Y = y;
         }
     }

     Point p1 = new Point(10, 20);
     p1.X = 30;  // ❌ Compilation error: cannot modify readonly property
     ```
   - Immutable structs are useful for ensuring **data integrity** and thread safety.

---

#### Why Does Mutability Matter?
- **Performance:**  
  Immutable objects can be optimized by the compiler and runtime for better performance.
- **Thread Safety:**  
  Immutable objects do not require synchronization, making them safer in multithreaded environments.
- **Data Integrity:**  
  Ensuring that values do not change unexpectedly improves code reliability and debugging.

### Common Pitfalls When Choosing
1. **Overusing Classes for Small Data:**
   If a class is used for small, frequently created objects, it can lead to excessive garbage collection, slowing down the application.

2. **Using Large Structs:**
   Structs should remain small; using large structs can lead to excessive memory copying and performance degradation.

3. **Ignoring Value vs Reference Semantics:**
   Accidentally treating structs like classes can result in unexpected behavior, such as failing to update values correctly.
