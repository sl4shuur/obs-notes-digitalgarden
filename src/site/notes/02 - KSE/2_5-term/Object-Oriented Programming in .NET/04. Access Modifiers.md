# Access Modifiers
---

Access modifiers in C# define the **visibility** and **accessibility** of classes, methods, and variables within a program. They help in **[[02 - KSE/2_5-term/Object-Oriented Programming in .NET/01. Intro to OOP#Encapsulation\|encapsulation]]**, ensuring that code components are properly restricted or exposed based on design requirements.

**Why Use Access Modifiers?**
- To control **access levels** to class members and prevent unintended modifications.
- To enforce **data hiding** and protect sensitive information.
- To establish **modular and maintainable** code structures.
## Public
---

The `public` access modifier allows members to be **accessible from anywhere** within the program, including different classes and assemblies.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Members marked as `public` have **no restrictions** on access.
- Suitable for components that are meant to be widely accessible, such as utility methods or global constants.
- Provides the **highest** level of accessibility.

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-green);">Example:</span></strong>
```csharp
public class Car
{
    public string Model;  // Public field accessible from anywhere

    public void Drive()   // Public method accessible from anywhere
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Driving...");
    }
}

Car myCar = new Car();
myCar.Model = "Toyota";  // Accessible from outside the Car class
myCar.Drive();           // Accessible from outside the Car class
```

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-aqua);">Explanation:</span></strong>
- The `Model` property and `Drive()` method can be accessed freely by other classes.
- Useful when designing libraries or APIs that need to provide public functionalities.

Metaphor:
It's like a public park where everyone can enter and enjoy the facilities without any restrictions.

**Common Use Cases:**
- Public API endpoints in libraries.
- Global utility classes and helper functions.
- Configuration settings that should be accessible across the application.

## Private
---

The `private` access modifier restricts access to members **only within the same class**, making them inaccessible from outside the class.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Members marked as `private` can only be accessed **inside the class** where they are declared.
- Ensures **data encapsulation**, preventing direct access and modification from external code.
- Provides the **highest level of data protection**.

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-green);">Example:</span></strong>
```csharp
public class BankAccount
{
    private decimal balance;  // Private field, accessible only within the class

    public void Deposit(decimal amount)
    {
        balance += amount;  // Accessible inside the class
    }

    public decimal GetBalance()
    {
        return balance;  // Exposing balance through a public method
    }
}

BankAccount account = new BankAccount();
account.Deposit(500);
// account.balance = 1000;  // Error: balance is private and cannot be accessed directly
Console.WriteLine(account.GetBalance());  // Accessing balance through a public method
```

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-aqua);">Explanation:</span></strong>
- The `balance` field is **private**, meaning it cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.
- Access is allowed only through the public methods `Deposit()` and `GetBalance()`.

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-purple);">Metaphor:</span></strong>
It's like a **personal safe** in your home—only you can access its contents, and others must go through you to retrieve anything.

**Common Use Cases:**
- Storing sensitive data such as passwords or account balances.
- Internal helper methods that shouldn't be exposed outside the class.
- Implementing encapsulation to avoid unintended modifications.

## Protected
---

The `protected` access modifier allows members to be **accessible within the same class** and **in derived (child) classes**, but not from outside those classes.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Members marked as `protected` can be accessed within their class and by **subclasses (derived classes)**.
- Supports **inheritance**, allowing child classes to reuse and extend functionality.
- Prevents access from outside the class hierarchy, maintaining a level of **encapsulation**.

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-green);">Example:</span></strong>
```csharp
public class Animal
{
    protected string Species;  // Protected field accessible in derived classes (Animal -> ...)

    protected void SetSpecies(string species)
    {
        Species = species;  // Accessible within the base class
    }
}

public class Dog : Animal
{
    public void Identify()
    {
        SetSpecies("Canine");  // Accessible from the derived class
        Console.WriteLine($"This animal is a {Species}");
    }
}

Dog myDog = new Dog();
myDog.Identify();
// myDog.SetSpecies("Canine");  // Error: protected method cannot be accessed directly
```

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-aqua);">Explanation:</span></strong>
- The `Species` field and `SetSpecies()` method are **protected**, meaning they can be accessed within the `Animal` class and its derived class `Dog`, but not from outside.
- Useful when designing a class hierarchy where base class data needs to be shared with subclasses.

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-purple);">Metaphor:</span></strong>
It's like **family secrets**—they are known within the family (class and subclasses) but hidden from outsiders.

**Common Use Cases:**
- Allowing child classes to access and modify parent class properties safely.
- Implementing core functionality in a base class and exposing it only to subclasses.
- Providing extensibility while maintaining encapsulation from unrelated classes.

### The difference between `private` and `protected`

The `private` access modifier restricts access to members within the same class, while the `protected` access modifier allows access within the same class and its derived classes.

```csharp
public class Parent
{
    private int privateField;
    protected int protectedField;

    public void AccessFields()
    {
        privateField = 10;    // Accessible within the same class
        protectedField = 20;  // Accessible within the same class
    }
}

public class Child : Parent
{
    public void AccessFields()
    {
        // privateField = 10;    // Error: private field is not accessible in derived class
        protectedField = 20;  // Accessible in derived class
    }
}

Parent child = new Child();
// child.privateField = 10;    // Error: private field is not accessible in derived class
// child.protectedField = 20;  // Error: protected field is not accessible outside the class
```

## Internal
---

The `internal` access modifier allows members to be **accessible only within the same assembly**, meaning they can be accessed by any code within the same project but not from another assembly.
TODO: Add a note about assembly
So, basically, assembly is a .dll or .exe file. We got it from the compilation of the code inside the certain project.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Members marked as `internal` are **restricted to the same assembly** (i.e., project).
- Useful for dividing functionality across multiple classes within a project while keeping it hidden from external assemblies.
- Provides a balance between **accessibility and encapsulation**.

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-green);">Example.</span></strong>

Project A (Assembly 1):
```csharp
internal class Logger
{
    internal void Log(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Log: {message}");
    }
}

// Accessible within the same assembly
Logger logger = new Logger();
logger.Log("Logging internal data.");
```

Project B (Assembly 2):
```csharp
// Error: Logger is not accessible from a different assembly
Logger logger = new Logger();
logger.Log("Logging internal data.");
```

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-aqua);">Explanation:</span></strong>
- The `Logger` class and its method `Log()` are accessible from anywhere **within the same assembly**, but trying to access them from a different assembly will result in an error.
- This is commonly used when building libraries or large projects where internal components shouldn't be exposed to consumers.

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-purple);">Metaphor:</span></strong>
It's like **company documents** — accessible to all employees within the organization, but hidden from outsiders.

**Common Use Cases:**
- Hiding implementation details that are not intended to be used outside of the project.
- Creating utility classes or helper functions specific to the project.
- Managing internal business logic that should not be exposed to external consumers.

## Protected Internal
---

The `protected internal` access modifier allows members to be **accessible within the same assembly** and **to derived (child) classes outside the assembly**. This means the member can be accessed by any code within the same project, and also by subclasses in different assemblies.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Members marked as `protected internal` are accessible **inside the same assembly**, similar to `internal` members.
- They can also be accessed **outside the assembly**, but only through **[[02 - KSE/2_5-term/Object-Oriented Programming in .NET/01. Intro to OOP#Inheritance\|inheritance]]**.
- Provides a combination of **protected** (accessible to derived classes) and **internal** (restricted to the same assembly) functionality.
  Protected + Internal = Protected Internal. Simple math!

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-green);">Example.</span></strong>

Project A (Assembly 1):
```csharp
public class BaseClass
{
    protected internal void ShowMessage()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Protected Internal Access");
    }
}

public class DerivedClass : BaseClass
{
    public void Display()
    {
        ShowMessage();  // Accessible in derived class within the same assembly
    }
}

// Accessible within the same assembly
BaseClass obj = new BaseClass();
obj.ShowMessage();  // Allowed within the same assembly
```

Project B (Assembly 2):
```csharp
public class AnotherDerivedClass : BaseClass
{
    public void Test()
    {
        ShowMessage();  // Accessible because of inheritance
    }
}

// BaseClass obj = new BaseClass();
obj.ShowMessage();  // Error: Cannot access without inheritance
```

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-aqua);">Explanation:</span></strong>
- The `ShowMessage()` method is accessible within the same assembly directly.
- In a different assembly, it is only accessible through inheritance (in derived classes).
- Direct instantiation in another assembly **without inheritance** is **not allowed**, ensuring encapsulation.

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-purple);">Metaphor:</span></strong>
It's like **family privileges within an organization**—  family members can access certain resources outside of the company, but outsiders can't access them unless they are part of the family.

**Common Use Cases:**
- Allowing derived classes in external projects to access specific members while keeping them hidden from unrelated classes.
- Providing extensibility while maintaining a level of internal control.
- Useful in frameworks where certain methods should be extendable but not publicly available.

## Private Protected
---

The `private protected` access modifier allows members to be **accessible within the same assembly** but **ONLY by derived (child) classes**, restricting access even further compared to `protected internal`.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Members marked as `private protected` can be accessed **only within the same assembly** and **only by derived classes**.
- It provides the <strong><span style="color: var(--color-red);">most restrictive combination</span></strong> of `protected` and `internal` by limiting access to subclasses within the same project.
- Not accessible from outside the assembly, even through inheritance.

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-green);">Example.</span></strong>

Project A (Assembly 1):
```csharp
public class BaseClass
{
    private protected void Display()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Private Protected Access");
    }
}

public class DerivedClass : BaseClass
{
    public void Show()
    {
        Display();  // Accessible in derived class within the same assembly
    }
}

BaseClass obj = new BaseClass();
obj.Display();  // Error: Cannot access from outside the class hierarchy
```

Project B (Assembly 2):
```csharp
public class AnotherDerivedClass : BaseClass
{
    public void Test()
    {
        Display();  // Error: Cannot access from a derived class in another assembly
    }
}
```

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-aqua);">Explanation:</span></strong>
- The `Display()` method is **accessible within the same assembly** in derived classes.
- It is **not accessible** in derived classes outside the assembly.
- Even direct instantiation and access within the same assembly outside of inheritance is not allowed.

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-purple);">Metaphor:</span></strong>
It's like **family secrets shared only within the household**, accessible to close family members but not to extended family or outsiders.

**Common Use Cases:**
- Providing internal extension capabilities within the same project while preventing unintended access from external code.
- Ensuring stricter encapsulation compared to `protected internal` by confining access within the assembly.
- Useful in large projects to limit access to critical internal functionalities only for sub-classing within the same module.

## Sealed Keyword

The `sealed` keyword is used to prevent a class from being inherited by other classes. When a class is marked as `sealed`, it cannot be used as a base class for other classes.

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-green);">Example:</span></strong>
```csharp
public sealed class FinalClass
{
    public void Display()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("This is a sealed class");
    }
}

// Error: Cannot inherit from a sealed class
public class DerivedClass : FinalClass
{
    // Code here
}
```
