# Intro to OOP

## Definition of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
---

OOP is a **programming paradigm** that organizes software design around **objects** rather than focusing on functions or logic.

An **object** is a data entity that consists of **attributes** (data fields) and **behaviors** (methods).

### Attributes (data fields)
Represent properties of the object.

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-green);">Example:</span></strong>
```csharp
class Car
{
    // Attributes (data fields, properties)
    public string Brand { get; set; }
    public string Model { get; set; }
    public int Year { get; set; }
}

// Creating an object
Car myCar = new Car();
myCar.Brand = "Toyota";
myCar.Model = "Camry";
myCar.Year = 2023;

// Accessing attributes
Console.WriteLine($"Car: {myCar.Brand} {myCar.Model}, Year: {myCar.Year}");
```

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-aqua);">Explanation:</span></strong>
- `Brand`, `Model`, and `Year` are **attributes** (also called properties), defining the characteristics of the `Car` object.
- The object `myCar` holds unique values for these attributes.
- Using `Console.WriteLine()`, we can retrieve the stored values.

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-purple);">Metaphor:</span></strong>
Attributes are like the **features** of a car (e.g., brand, model, year). Each car object has its own set of features, just like different cars on the road.

### Behavior (methods)
Define actions the object can perform.

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-green);">Example:</span></strong>
```csharp
class Car
{
    // Attributes (data fields, properties)
    public string Brand { get; set; }
    public string Model { get; set; }
    public int Year { get; set; }

    // Behavior (Method)
    public void Drive()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{Brand} {Model} is driving.");
    }
}

// Creating an object and calling a method
Car myCar = new Car { Brand = "Honda", Model = "Civic", Year = 2022 };
myCar.Drive();
```

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-aqua);">Explanation:</span></strong>
- The `Drive()` method defines a behavior that prints a message when called.
- Once the object `myCar` is created and initialized, invoking `myCar.Drive()` simulates the action of driving.
- This demonstrates how behaviors encapsulate functionality inside an object.

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-purple);">Metaphor:</span></strong>
Behaviors are like the **actions** a car can perform (e.g., driving, honking). Each car object can perform these actions, just like real cars on the road.

## Key OOP Concepts
---

### Classes  
A **class** is a template (scheme) for creating objects. It defines the **attributes** (data) and **methods** (behaviors) that the objects created from the class will have.

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-green);">Example:</span></strong>
```csharp
class Person
{
    // Attributes (data fields)
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }

    // Behavior (method)
    public void Greet()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Hello, my name is {Name} and I am {Age} years old.");
    }
}

// Creating an object
Person person1 = new Person { Name = "Alice", Age = 30 };
person1.Greet();
```

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-aqua);">Explanation:</span></strong>
- `Person` is a **class**, serving as a blueprint for creating multiple objects.
- The `Greet()` method is a behavior that outputs a message with the object's details.
- The object `person1` holds specific values for `Name` and `Age` attributes.

### Objects  
An **object** is an instance of a class that contains specific data and behaviors.

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-green);">Example:</span></strong>
```csharp
class Dog
{
    public string Breed { get; set; }
    public string Color { get; set; }

    public void Bark()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"The {Color} {Breed} is barking.");
    }
}

// Creating objects
Dog dog1 = new Dog { Breed = "Labrador", Color = "Black" };
Dog dog2 = new Dog { Breed = "Beagle", Color = "Brown" };

dog1.Bark();
dog2.Bark();
```

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-aqua);">Explanation:</span></strong>
- `dog1` and `dog2` are **objects** created from the `Dog` class.
- Each object has its own unique values for `Breed` and `Color`.
- The `Bark()` method represents the behavior associated with the dog object.

### Inheritance  
Inheritance allows a class to acquire the properties and methods of another class.

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-green);">Example:</span></strong>
```csharp
class Animal
{
    public void Eat()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("This animal is eating.");
    }
}

// `:` denotes inheritance. Dog <- Animal (Dog inherits from Animal)
class Dog : Animal
{
    public void Bark()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The dog is barking.");
    }
}

// Using inheritance
Dog myDog = new Dog();
myDog.Eat();  // Inherited method
myDog.Bark();
```

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-aqua);">Explanation:</span></strong>
- The `Dog` class inherits from the `Animal` class, gaining its behaviors.
- This promotes **code reuse**, reducing duplication and improving maintainability.

### Encapsulation  
Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) within a single unit, restricting direct access to certain parts.

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-green);">Example:</span></strong>
```csharp
class BankAccount
{
    private double balance;  // Private attribute

    public void Deposit(double amount)
    {
        balance += amount;
    }

    public double GetBalance()
    {
        return balance;
    }
}

// Using encapsulation
BankAccount account = new BankAccount();
account.Deposit(1000);
Console.WriteLine($"Balance: {account.GetBalance()}");

// Direct access to balance is restricted!
account.balance = 5000;  // Error: 'BankAccount.balance' is inaccessible due to its protection level
```

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-aqua);">Explanation:</span></strong>
- `balance` is a private attribute, accessible only via the `Deposit()` and `GetBalance()` methods.
- Encapsulation protects data from unauthorized access and modification.
- The object's internal state is hidden, ensuring better data integrity.

### Polymorphism  
Polymorphism allows methods to have different implementations based on the object that invokes them.

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-green);">Example:</span></strong>
```csharp
class Shape
{
    // `virtual` keyword allows overriding in subclasses
    public virtual void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a shape.");
    }
}

class Circle : Shape
{
    public override void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a circle.");
    }
}

class Square : Shape
{
    public override void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a square.");
    }
}

// Using polymorphism
Shape shape1 = new Circle();
Shape shape2 = new Square();
Shape shape3 = new Shape();

shape1.Draw(); // Output: Drawing a circle.
shape2.Draw(); // Output: Drawing a square.
shape3.Draw(); // Output: Drawing a shape.
```

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-aqua);">Explanation:</span></strong>
- The `Draw()` method behaves differently based on the specific class type.
- This enables flexibility and scalability in handling different object types through a common interface.

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-purple);">Metaphor:</span></strong>
Polymorphism is like a like ordering a coffee at a caf√©. The same command ("coffee, please") can result in different outcomes based on the type of coffee (espresso, latte, cappuccino) you want receive.

### Abstraction  
Abstraction hides complex implementation details and only shows essential features to the user.

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-green);">Example:</span></strong>
```csharp
abstract class Appliance
{
    // `abstract` keyword
    public abstract void TurnOn();
}

class WashingMachine : Appliance
{
    public override void TurnOn()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Washing machine is now running.");
    }
}

// Using abstraction
Appliance myAppliance = new WashingMachine();
myAppliance.TurnOn();
```

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-aqua);">Explanation:</span></strong>
- `Appliance` is an abstract class that defines a generic operation `TurnOn()`.
- The concrete class `WashingMachine` provides the actual implementation.
- Users can interact with the high-level interface without worrying about the inner workings.

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-purple);">Metaphor:</span></strong>
Using abstraction is like driving a car. You know how to **steer**, **accelerate**, and **brake**, but you DO NOT need to understand how the engine, transmission, or braking system works internally. The car abstracts these complexities, providing a simple interface (steering wheel, pedals, dashboard) to the driver.

### Key Differences Between Abstraction and Polymorphism

| Aspect             | Abstraction                                | Polymorphism                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Focus**          | Hiding complex details                     | Multiple behaviors under a common interface       |
| **Purpose**        | Defines "what" should be done              | Defines "how" objects behave differently          |
| **Keyword**        | `abstract` classes, `interface`            | `virtual`, `override`                            |
| **Implementation** | Abstract classes, Interfaces               | Method Overriding, Method Overloading             |
| **Example**        | Appliance with a general `TurnOn()` method | Different shapes having their own `Draw()`        |
| **Metaphor**       | Car dashboard (hides internal complexity)  | Universal remote (same action, different results) |

### When to Use Abstraction vs. Polymorphism

1. **Use Abstraction when:**
   - You want to provide a simple, unified interface for complex systems (e.g., using interfaces or abstract classes).
   - <strong><span style="color: var(--color-green);">Example:</span></strong> Creating an `Animal` class with an abstract `MakeSound()` method, which forces subclasses to implement their own sounds.

2. **Use Polymorphism when:**
   - You want the same interface to represent different behaviors depending on the specific object.
   - <strong><span style="color: var(--color-green);">Example:</span></strong> Allowing different types of `PaymentProcessor` (CreditCard, PayPal) to process payments differently but under the same interface.
## Explanation and Insights

### Why OOP Matters

- **Mimicking real-world entities:** OOP reflects how real-world objects interact, making software development more intuitive.
- **Encapsulation improves security:** Sensitive data is protected from unintended modifications.
- **Code reusability:** Inheritance allows developers to reuse existing logic, reducing duplication.
- **Flexibility and scalability:** Polymorphism enables writing generic and adaptable code.

### Metaphors to Understand OOP

1. **Classes and Objects:** A **class** is like a cookie cutter, and an **object** is the cookie made from it. Each cookie (object) follows the same shape but can have different ingredients (attributes).
2. **Encapsulation:** Think of encapsulation as a **capsule pill**, where medicine (data) is safely enclosed and only released in controlled ways.
3. **Inheritance:** Similar to how children inherit traits from their parents, subclasses inherit properties and behaviors from their parent classes.
4. **Polymorphism:** A **universal remote control** can operate multiple devices (TV, AC, speakers), but each responds differently to the same command.
5. **Abstraction:** When driving a car, you don't need to understand the engine's internal workings. You interact with the car through a simplified interface (steering wheel, pedals).
