# My Digital Garden

---

## Who is me? 🐣

Hello, there! 👋
My name is <strong><span style="color: var(--color-pink);">Denys</span></strong> and I am a curious soul, a lifelong learner. I was born in <strong><span style="color: var(--color-cyan);">Kherson</span></strong>, **Ukraine** (if someone is interested...) and currently live in <strong><span style="color: var(--color-aqua);">Kyiv</span></strong>, where I study at <strong><span style="color: var(--color-blue);">KSE (Kyiv School of Economics)</span></strong> for an AI engineer 🤖
I am passionate about <strong><span style="color: var(--color-orange);">maths</span></strong> and its beautiful applications in the real world 😍
I believe that learning is a **journey**, and this digital garden is where my thoughts, ideas, and lessons bloom. 🌿
I follow the <strong><span style="color: var(--color-red);">Zettelkasten method</span></strong>, where every note links to another, forming a rich network of insights.

## What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is a mix between a notebook and a blog, it is a place to share thoughts and cultivate them into a garden. It also allows me to have a place where I can store my notes/summaries/tutorials for my studies.

The main difference to a blog is that a blog has articles and publication dates and never changes after it has been published, whereas a digital garden is a place where the written content can be continuously edited and refined. The notes are also very free flowing they can span from just a short cheatsheet to a full set of notes on an entire subject where you go into every nitty-gritty detail.

Another key difference is the navigation. A blog is usually read in chronological order but a digital garden can be read in any order you want and uses lots of internal links to connect all the notes into a Network (although this can be quite hard to diligently do).

If you are interested in learning more about digital gardens I can recommend the following [article by Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).

## Why This Garden Exists 🌼

I created this space to:

- 🌱 Cultivate knowledge from my studies and experiences.
- 📚 Connect dots between different subjects and disciplines.
- 💡 Share insights with future me (and maybe you too). Tbh, here I locate only public notes, I have a lot of other in private access.

## How was my Garden Built? 🛠️

Creating this digital garden wasn’t just about putting notes online — it was about building a **home for my thoughts**. Here’s a little behind-the-scenes look at how this garden grew from an idea to reality:

### Tools and Frameworks

- 📝 **Note-taking System:** I use **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)** to draft and interlink my notes using the <strong><span style="color: var(--color-red);">Zettelkasten method</span></strong>. This method turns my thoughts into a network, helping me discover unexpected connections.
- 🖥️ **Markdown for Structure:** All my notes are written in <strong><span style="color: var(--color-cyan);">Markdown</span></strong>, a simple and powerful format that keeps my focus on content rather than formatting.
- 💻 **Version Control:** I store everything in a **[GitHub repository](https://github.com/sl4shuur/obs-notes-digitalgarden)**, so my garden always has a history. Mistakes can’t kill the plants — they only help them grow!
- 🌐 **Publishing Platform:** I use **[Digital Garden plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/)** in Obsidian along with **[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)** to deploy these notes as a rendered HTML page.

### The Structure: How I Organize Notes 💡

Tbh, for now I do not have specific structure, but I am working on it 🙃
Since I am a student at <strong><span style="color: var(--color-blue);">KSE</span></strong>, I have a folder for my studies there, where I store all the notes from the lectures and seminars. You can find them in the left sidebar.

> [!warning] WARNING!
> Some notes could be in **Ukrainian** (since I am Ukrainian and sometimes I write notes in my _native language_ yo!).
> But I am trying to make everything in English, if it is possible... So pls, do not be confused about that.

Furthermore, you can see the **graph of my notes** on the right side of the page. It is generated by the <strong><span style="color: var(--color-purple);">Obsidian</span></strong> and this is the main feature of the <strong><span style="color: var(--color-red);">Zettelkasten method</span></strong>. So try to use it to navigate through the notes, this kinda fun.

<strong><span style="color: var(--color-aqua);">I also use</span></strong>:

- 📆 **Table of contents**: ToC is really helpful to navigate to specific heading inside the note.
- 🌐 **Backlinks:** To show connections between ideas.
- 📅 **Dates:** To keep track of when notes were created or updated.
- 📂 **Tags:** To categorize notes and make them easier to find. (use `Ctrl + K` to find the specific note/tag)

## KSE Haunt Event | Stage 4

I don’t remember when it all went dark.

Somewhere between the dreams and the echoes, I left something behind.

Maybe **_Quieter_** times once _**Laughed**_,  
or **Whispers** from the past trying to _wake_ me.

Who knows if we’ll _**a**_ctually find **A**nswers?

Maybe **8** nights of silence **u**nraveled **z**er0 hope...

Do you still **H**ear the _**D**istant_ **D**rumbeats?

Maybe that’s how **d**reams _persist_.

Pray. _**X**pect_ Nothing.**P**repare.

_**8** is the final key._
